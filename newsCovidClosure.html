			<h3><em>Published May 15, 2020</em></h3>

			<p>We are sorry to announce that we have decided to temporarily close all of our hiking trails and facilities, due to growing concerns of COVID-19. Closures are scheduled to take place starting Monday next week, May 18th. We aim to reopen our resort in August of this year, but will delay our reopening depending on the severity of the pandemic at that time.

			<p>While we are saddened to have to end the season early, please know we take health concerns like these seriously, as the safety and wellbeing of our guests and staff are of utmost importance. We will keep you up to date on all the latest developments of this situation, as well as news of eventual reopening here on our site. Join our email list to be notified on every post.</p>

			<p>We hope to see you on our trails again soon, happy and healthy!</p>
