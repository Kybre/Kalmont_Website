			<h3><em>Published May 2, 2020</em></h3>

			<p>The Kalmont Mountain Safety and Rescue Team has donated $20,000 directly to the Kalmont COVID-19 Relief Fund in support of the government’s effort to combat COVID-19 within the region of Kalmont.</p>

			<p>Since February, more than $200,000 has been donated to the Kalmont COVID-19 Relief Fund. The local government directs this money to the appropriate organizations, in an attempt to have the region of Kalmont come together and combat COVID-19 together. The COVID-19 Relief Fund alone has allowed organizations to supply over 1 million protective masks, as well as tens of thousands of sets of protective equipment for our local healthcare workers.</p>

			<p>In a statement to the press, KMSRT Founder and President Dr. Victor Freeze said, “COVID-19 has placed us in troubling times, and it truly is disheartening to see this impact other people’s enjoyment of the outdoors. We hope the city of Kalmont can come together and overcome these turbulent times together, and build a better tomorrow.”</p>
