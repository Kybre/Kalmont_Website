			<p>We at the Kalmont Mountain Safety and Rescue Team are proud to announce that starting tomorrow, June 2nd, we will be offering new, KMSRT branded face masks! Show your Kalmont spirit in two colours: Kalmont Blue and Rescue Red, in sizes for children and adults. 50% of all mask sales will go towards Kalmont Cityâ€™s COVID-19 Relief Fund.</p>

			<p>Stop by the Kalmont Mountain Lodge Gift Shop, or visit  www.shopkalmont.ca from the comfort of your home to get your very own KMSRT mask for the low, low price of $12.99, while supplies last. We are also offering a special 20% off of all T-shirts and water bottles.</p>

			<p>NOTE**: The wearing of masks in public places is recommended by the BC Ministry of health. Social distancing measures still apply. KMSRT masks are not medical-grade and are therefore only recommended for non-medical use. The KMSRT is not liable for any ailments caught while wearing KMSRT branded masks.</p>
